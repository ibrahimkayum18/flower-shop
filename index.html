                    <p>The Shahbag Flower Market is a well-known location for having flowers for every occasion. It is particularly great for weddings or events as they require a lot of flowers for decoration purpose which the shops are capable of delivering at a reduced cost. The shops at Shahbag sell flowers both local and foreign in both retail and wholesale. Many of the flower shops in Dhaka also get their inventory from here. <a href="#">See more...</a> </p>

                    <p>Not far from Gulshan 1 circle, thereâ€™s a small gift shop that sells beautiful decorative items along with some wonderfully arranged colorful flowers. At first glance, this shop might not seem very remarkable, but what sold inside is. Sygmaz has garnered a reputation for themselves as one of the best flower shops in Dhaka that sells exotic and enchanting flowers. Most of their flowers are used for their event management activities, but they also sell them both retail and wholesale. <a href="#">See more...</a></p>

                    <h3>PUSHPO NIR FLOWER SHOP</h3>
                    <p>One of the major perks of living in Gulshan is convenience. Everything that is found in the rest of the city usually can be found within the bounds of the area; in better quality no less. The Pushpo Nir Flower Shop in Gulshan 2 is such a place. Along with Sygmaz Gift Shop, Pushpo Nir sells high-quality fresh flowers in the area. However, whereas Sygmaz specializes in weddings, Pushpo Nir Specializes in bouquets and corporate events. <a href="#">See more...</a></p>

                    <h3>BANANI FLOWER SHOPS</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the Shahbag, Banani has a flower market of its own. While it might not be as large or expansive as the one in Shahbag, it is nonetheless my favorite. The flowers sold here have a certain charm to them. They tend to be more unique and eye-catchy than flowers sold in other places. A wide variety of roses and orchids are found here year-round along with many colorful flowers. One can easily spend hours taking in the beauty of these wonderful items. <a href="#">See more...</a></p>
